# Title - Gitesh's English Dictionary
## 1. Description
At first, I got the user searched input, and then using the fetch API method I sent a get request to an API (dictionaryapi.dev) with passing the user searched word. If the searched word exists then API returns an object of the searched word which holds many details (definition, example, synonyms) of the word else it returns a message of “Can’t find the definitions”. Once I fetched the data from API then I inserted each data into a particular HTML element. This website is build using vanilla js Stack, which includes languages like Html, Css ,Js and I have used netlify hosting service to host my project.
